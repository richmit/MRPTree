
This directory examples that apply *MRPTree* to the problem of
mathematical function visualization.  You can read more about
these examples [[https://www.mitchr.me/SS/MRPTree/func-viz/index.html][here]].

This is an area I'm personally interested in, and it provides a good
source of visually interesting examples that make pretty full use of
*MRPTree*'s capabilities.
